# Point-of-Sale (POS) System for Hardware Store
This project is a C#-based Point-of-Sale (POS) system tailored for a hardware store, built using Windows Forms and SQLite. The application provides role-based access, allowing Admins to manage inventory, users, and generate sales reports, while Cashiers can perform day-to-day sales operations. The system includes real-time inventory tracking, receipt generation, and user management, ensuring a streamlined, efficient experience for both administrators and cashiers.
Key Features:

    Login Form: Secure user authentication with role-based access to Admin or Cashier interfaces.
    Admin Dashboard: Comprehensive inventory management, user role management, and daily sales reporting.
    Cashier Interface: Easy item selection, cart management, real-time total calculation, change calculation, and receipt printing.

Technologies Used:

    C# .NET (Windows Forms)
    SQLite (Database for storing user data, inventory, and sales records)
    Inno Setup (for creating an installer package)

This repository provides all necessary source code, database files, and instructions to set up and deploy the POS system locally.
